# MSTU 5013 Final Project: DonateMed
  * Web url: https://hc3099.github.io/DonateMed/index.html 
  * Instructional Technology and Media, Teachers College, Columbia University


## Summary  
* Background: This website is designed for COVID-19 resources matching. Recently, countries around the world are being affected by COVID-19. Every single industry is suffering but those who worked in the hospitals are being hit the hardest.


* Problem Statement: Due to the sudden wave of cases, hospitals and healthcare workers are faced with shortages of protective gear. Fortunately, a lot of people around the world have quickly stepped up to the challenge and made contributions to these frontline workers by donating their own supplies of PPE such as masks, goggles, and face shields. It was truly inspiring to see people banding together to help each other, especially in these tough times. However, donors sometimes have difficulties identifying which medical center has the most urgent needs and whether their donations are going to the right place. This website is designed in hopes of unifying all sources into one place to better streamline the donation process and to ensure transparency between donors and donees.

## Collaboration:

* We divide the website into different sections with functions and features.
